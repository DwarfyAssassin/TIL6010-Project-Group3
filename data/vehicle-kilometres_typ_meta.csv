"A018935";"Delivery van";"Goods road vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3500 kg, designed, exclusively or primarily, to carry goods. Included are vans designed for and used primarily for transport of goods, pick-ups and small lorries with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3500 kg. To calculate the total traffic performance of delivery vans on Dutch roads, it is necessary to estimate the traffic performance of foreign delivery vans in the Netherlands. In the absence of data on foreign delivery vans, it has been assumed that this concerns mainly border traffic. That is why the traffic performance of foreign delivery vans in the Netherlands is set equal to the traffic performance of Dutch delivery vans abroad."
