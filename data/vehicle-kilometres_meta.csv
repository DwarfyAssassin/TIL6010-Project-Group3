Status of the figures:

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This table contains information on traffic performance (vehicle-kilometres) of passenger cars, delivery vans, lorries, semi-trailers, special purpose vehicles and buses.  
Vehicle-kilometres of Dutch vehicles have been broken down by Dutch vehicles on Dutch territory and Dutch vehicles on foreign territory.  
In addition, there are figures on the total distance covered on Dutch territory. A distinction is made between kilometres covered by Dutch vehicles and kilometres by foreign vehicles.  

For the 2020 data a correction factor was implemented to correct for the ‘smoothing effect’ caused by the method. The smoothing effect smoothes out yearly variation in the data and this results in a distorted picture of periods of time when mobility patterns suddenly change drastically, like happened in 2020 due to COVID-19. Information on the smoothing effect can be found in the <a href='https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/onderzoeksomschrijvingen/korte-onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/verkeersprestaties-personenauto-s'>methodological description</a> (only available in Dutch). 

From 2016 up the kilometres driven by busses are no longer devided in kilometres driven on Dutch or on foreign roads.

Status of the figures:

2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATIONS OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Traffic performance
Distance covered by (motor) vehicles over a certain period, expressed in vehicle-kilometres. 

Vehicle-kilometre
Unit of measurement for traffic, representing the movement of a vehicle over one kilometre.

Passenger car
Road motor vehicle, other than a moped or a motor cycle, intended for the carriage of passengers and designed to seat no more than nine persons (including the driver).

Delivery van
Goods road vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3500 kg, designed, exclusively or primarily, to carry goods.
Included are vans designed for and used primarily for transport of goods, pick-ups and small lorries with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3500 kg.

Lorry (road tractor not included)
Rigid heavy goods road vehicle with a gross vehicle weight above 3500 kg, exclusively or primarily designed to carry goods.

Road tractor
Road motor vehicle, exclusively or primarily designed to haul other road vehicles which are not power-driven (mainly semi-trailers).
Agricultural tractors are not included.

Special purpose vehicle
Road motor vehicle designed for purposes other than the carriage of passengers or goods.
As of May 1, 2009 motor homes are registered as passenger cars or bus depending on the number of seats. Before that date motor homes are registered as special purpose vehicles.

Bus
Passenger road motor vehicle designed to seat more than nine persons (including the driver).

Explanation of symbols:

Empty cell	: figure not applicable
. 		: figure is unknown, insufficiently reliable or confidential
*		: provisional figure 
**		: revised provisional figure

Figures are rounded off to the nearest 100,000 kilometres. Consequently, the sum of the detail data can deviate from the total.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

Effective from 1 January 2014, Statistics Netherlands receives data from the Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW) on passenger cars, light commercial vehicles (<=3,500 kg) and heavy commercial vehicles (> 3,500 kg). Based on the data obtained from this new supplier, depending on the type of vehicle, figures have been calculated starting either from reporting year 2011 or reporting year 2012. 

For reporting years 2001 up to and including 2010/2011, figures have been calculated using odometer readings from the NAP database (Nationale AutoPas). 

The survey method for this table can be found in the various survey descriptions (only in Dutch available)
