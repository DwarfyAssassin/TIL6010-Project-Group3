"Sources"
Key;Title;Description
"A025421";"Total mobile sources";"Mobile sources comprise transport equipment and mobile machinery with a combustion engine, inclusive of foreign transport and shipping on the Dutch part of the European Continental Shelf. The Continental Shelf is the area in between the low water line and a water depth of 200 metres at a distance of maximum of 200 miles from the coastline. From 1960 until 1975 the North Sea States entered into treaties to establish the borders on the Continental Shelf."
"A049055";"Total inland transport";"Mobile sources excluding mobile machinery and navigation on the Dutch part of the European Continental Shelf. The Continental Shelf is the area in between the low water line and a water depth of 200 metres at a distance of maximum of 200 miles from the coastline. From 1960 until 1975 the North Sea States entered into treaties to establish the borders on the Continental Shelf."
